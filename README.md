I'm making this game as part of [Juice](https://github.com/hackclub/juice/tree/main).

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

you crash landed on an alien planet and must retrieve all the parts of your spaceship to go home! you must learn the language of the aliens so they can help you!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

the player will gradually learn the alien language! they will need to recognize symbols, remember their meanings, and choose the right answer. there will be hints as to what each symbol means (ex. a symbol on a locked door that means “stop”). all aliens are friendly at first and they are there to help you, but only if you can say the right thing to them. there are also puzzle doors or different pathways that have signs in alien language.

because the player is on a different planet, the physics/gravity of this world is very different! the gravity changes in different places, the strength, direction of it. in some places, you can walk on the walls or the ceiling. some places the gravity is incredibly strong, others you are just floating. there might be gravity streams, magnet walls, and also places where the controls are inverted. instead of jumping, the player has a jetpack that they use to thrust themselves in different directions. you refuel by standing on ground. finally, the player will have limited oxygen and they need to move pretty quickly to capture oxygen bubbles to stay alive.

all the aliens will be friendly unless you say the wrong thing to them, and all of the alien plants are deadly. there are gaseous mushrooms, big carnivorious plants, etc,

**How does the game actually play?**

there will be 5 different levels (haven’t been planned entirely yet). first evel will be the player has just crash landed and the player is learning that they need to find all 5 pieces of the rocket that got spread around the planet to return home. they learn their first few words in alien language, and learn to move around properly. they also learn they must avoid the plants!

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game?**

the levels will get increasingly harder, they will need to learn more parts of the alien language and navigate through the alien world even better.
