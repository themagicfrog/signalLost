# VENDING MACHINE

I'm making this game as part of [Juice](https://github.com/hackclub/juice/tree/main).
The basic premise is you got stuck in vending machine and must escape!!!

The game idea is:
The player has to find vents and wires in the vending machine to escape.
Theyâ€™ll have to avoid dangers, like cockroaches and moldy food, and try to collect coins in the machine.
Sometimes, the bags of chips or bottles of juice will shift and if the player is hit by it, they will die.
It is a pretty fast-paced game.

The player must clear all the different levels of the vending machine, each filled with different kind of challenges.

There are multiple levels and each level gets harder. It will began with the top level of the vending machine, which is
pretty much empty and they begin to learn how to play, to use controls, avoid roaches, collect coins, slide on wires,
go into tubes, etc.

The next level will be filled with chip bags, so they now have bigger obstacles to avoid, as well as
spikey chips... the levels will continue to get harder. The final level will be the bottom most layer of the vending
machine, filled with bottles of juice that are leaking and making controlling the character difficult.

When the player
finally escapes the last layer, they are free and they win the game!
